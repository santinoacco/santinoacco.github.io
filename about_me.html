									<h2><a href="#">A brief recap of<br />
                                            my professional journey</a></h2>
									<p>
                                    Born and raised in Patagonia,
                                    I grew up very close to nature which I believe seed a passion for the world around me.
                                    I recall being very curious since an early age, and thankfully I carried that to eventually pursue a carrier in Physics.
                                    Along my journey I not only fulfilled that hunger for knowledge but also I found myself in a never ending playground.
                                    It is exciting to tackle a new problem,
                                    to plan the project and it is a thrill to dive into the struggle;
                                    where we put ourselves, our models, our methods and our tools to a test.
                                    But perhaps what is more important is that at the end of the task,
                                    the team has grown in understanding and we can provide real,
                                    tangible value to our clients or colleagues.
                                    <br />
                                    I was quite wise to follow great mentors that came along,
                                    many professors that not only shared their time and knowledge but that taught me great values for my professional life,
                                    I am talking <i>dedication</i>, <i>commitment</i>, <i>honor to the schedules</i>, <i>fellowship</i> and <i>perseverance</i>.
                                    But perhaps the most fundamental and useful tool that I got to practice through all my university years was the art of team-working.
                                    There is no science without that ingredient nor fun at all.
                                    So those elements are not only always strongly present in my mind,
                                    but I believe they drove me,
                                    along with my friends and colleagues to face our first projects.
                                    <br />
                                    <!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FIRST PROJECTs-->
                                    I think there are two very different projects,
                                    that without going to much into detail,
                                    showcase some of my key personal attributes.
                                    Both of them were carried out my last two years of Master,
                                    but the first one was my first experience working in a real research team in an active field of study,
                                    on a topic relevant for many scenarios;
                                    I am talking about studying the behavior of a collection of autonomous objects.
                                    There are many systems that fit in that previous description,
                                    to mention only a few,
                                    we have: the flight patterns of a flock of birds,
                                    the growth patterns of a population of bacteria,
                                    and many others.
                                    Physicists have found, through Statistical Mechanics,
                                    that many systems share common behaviors and properties even though they might be very different at first glance,
                                    this is known as been part of a class of universality;
                                    and its extension and applicability is huge,
                                    since it allows to extrapolate results from controlled environment to very complex systems.
                                    Now in this context is where we carried a Vicksek Simulation,
                                    to study the effects of different model dynamics on the flight patterns of birds of flocks.
                                    There results are quite technical,
                                    but the whole process was a great experience where I improved my programming skills for simulations,
                                    and it was the first real problem where I applied my knowledge on Statistical Mechanics and Statistical Analysis.
                                    The second project was a BusLine-Layout Optimization for my city's bus system.
                                    I am very proactive to tackle new projects,
                                    and at the time I was looking for a project to extend and practice my programming and analysis skills,
                                    so I started working on a model to improve the BusLine system of my city.
                                    Happily, some of my friends and colleagues join me in that task.
                                    We advanced enough to get a meeting with the transit council secretary,
                                    and even though they liked the project,
                                    they didn't have resources (and probably neither will) to deploy the project.
                                    <br />
                                    <!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FREELANCE PROJECTS-->
                                    This passion for improving my surrounding through hard, scientific work hasn't diminished,
                                    on the contrary,
                                    in my free time (if and when I get some) I work as a freelance Data Scientist.
                                    I look for projects I feel I can provide great value while being challenging within my skills set and in a reasonable time frame.
                                    Through these projects I was able to learn a lot about customer service, project planning and negotiation.
                                    I am very proud of what I have accomplished so far,
                                    and the perfect rating in Freelancer backs it up.
