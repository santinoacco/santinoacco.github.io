									<!-- Motivation -->
									A Cross-Promotion is a particular case of a digital publishing campaign that involves two products (typically) owned by the same company.
									The goal of this campaign is to leverage the strength of the better product to grow (or improve) some aspect of the other,
									hence the stronger product acts as a Publisher hosting the ads for the other product.
									The latter is known as the Advertiser.
									If the cost of taken by the publisher to display the adds of the advertiser is below the expected improvement gained on the advertiser side,
									then the campaign is said to be successful.
									Optimizing this kind of campaigns presents a great challenge since one has to account for the cost taken by the publisher,
									the predicted gain of the advertiser,
									as well as the underlying relationship between the two agents.
									This project aimed to estimate with high precision the cost taken by publisher,
									which was selected to be Sniper3D.
									As a result,
									a tool able to estimate the cost with 3% uncertainty on the retention metric & 10% uncertainty on the monetization metric,
									was deployed in the shape of a Python powered library.
								</p>
								<p>
									The setup was layed as follows.
									As mention above,
									the Publisher agent was chosen to be the Sniper3D for its robustness over the years and well understood dynamics;
									for the Advertiser agent the chosen game was WarMachines.
									We established a constraint assuming that the interaction between the agents was weak enough to be discarded,
									in other words we assumed that the underlying relationship between the Publisher game and the Advertiser game didn't impact the cost estimation on the chosen metrics.
									In addition,
									since we focused only on the Publisher side we restricted ourselves to computing the cost based solely on the Publisher contribution.
								</p>
								<p>
									The solution to the cost estimation,
									and packaged into the python tool,
									was essentially a collection of control experiments (A/B tests) for the retention and monetization metrics.
									For these given metrics we could look at their distributions and test on different groups the simulated impact of the ads.
									Thus we could measure for different thresholds the tolerance and variance of the causal impact.
									As a result we showed and computed that we were able to estimate a causal fluctuation of 3% (10%) for the retention (monetization) metric,
									with a C.I. level of 90%.
									Estimating the final cost was then rather straight forward since we only needed to multiply this difference with the predicted average revenue of the corresponding sample.
								</p>
								<p>
									The tech stack used to carry out the analysis and share the results involved:
									SciPy library, Pandas library, Numpy library, Matplotlib library, PySpark and DataBricks dashboards.
