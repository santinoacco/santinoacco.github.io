				<h3>A brief introduction ...</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- Intro -->
					This project encompasses the development & deployment of a Simulator Engine,
					encapsulated in a Python package.
					The goal of the Simulator is to generate synthetic samples that resemble the signatures measured by Tractian sensors,
					for as many different types of assets in as many possible operating scenarios,
					health conditions and external constrains.
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- Motivation -->
					Having an easy-to-use, trustful, feature-rich, extensible and very flexible Tool capable of producing labeled (synthetic) datasets,
					opens a world of opportunities for Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineering Teams.
					The operating conditions of some assets is so unusual (yet crucial) that it is very hard to collect data to train ML models,
					however with a Tool like this one it is easy to overcome this issue.
					Among other use-cases, 
					it enables to build speed up development since it reduces the effort & time taken to find a training data-set,
					and a common data-set can be reused to define performance baselines.
					It can create data-sets for testing environments and to build virtual experiments.
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- Project structure -->
					This project faced me with great challenges, 
					both technical and of coordination.
					As the project leader with the support and availability of other 7 Data Scientist,
					I structured the development & deliverable cycle into 3 initial phases.
					In the first stage, 
					which took about a month, 
					consisted on drafting the package (tool) structure,
					validating the approach,
					creating the beta-release for testing & feedback assessment,
					and setting the success metrics and goals of the tool.
					The second stage was aimed to increase the power, coverage and flexibility of the tool.
					For that purpose it was necessary to onboard 4 of the Data Scientist into the development cycle of the package.
					With their contributions, added fixes & improvements we were able to release version 1 in record time,
					just over a month.
					The third phase has a period of consolidation, 
					feedback collection and market spread.
					We are continuously increasing the power of the tool as the features are required.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h3>A deep overview of the Simulator</h3>
				<p>
					Technically the Tool has two components:
					a collection of Seeds,
					<!-- as a collection of files; -->
					and the Engine that synthesizes the samples from the Seeds.
					<!-- and the Engine packaged as a python package. -->

					<!-- The project outcome was a classifier tool for photons that is deployed using the ONNX format for the CNN model.
					Objects in ATLAS are stored in a NoSQL file format that has a directory structure of custom objects representing an event.
					The tool is fed with this files,
					from where it reads the raw features and processes them to input a heatmap (energy distribution) to the CNN.
					The model was fully developed using TensorFlow and Keras in a custom and dynamic manner. -->
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- Result -->
					<!-- Both the Signal Efficiency (Recall) and Background Rejection show remarkable improvements with respect to the baseline tool.
					In particular we showed for a set Background Rejection a 20% improvement in the Signal Efficiency against the baseline all the coordinate range. -->
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- Tech Stack -->
					<!-- The full framework has been developed using C++, Python, Keras & TensorFlow.
					Some of the key Python libraries used are: PyRoot, uproot, scikit-hep, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy & Numba. -->
				</p>
					<!--Since it's a quite complex project and the source code won't be available for people outside the collaboration,-->
					<!--I had added a set of slides to showcase the project.-->
