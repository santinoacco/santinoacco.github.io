    <p>This was a project I carried out for a PhD student in Medicine.
    I go over a medical dataset to assert the effectiveness of a novel apheresis method developed by the costumer.
    Employing basic statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing and linear regressions I conclude that the introduced method is highly superior than its predecessor,
    resulting in a 42(5)% efficiency increase,
    a 33(9)% increase in security (reduction of toxicity) and an estimated annual savings of 12.3(4.1)k u$.
    All of this carried out using Python3, SciPy, NumPy and others.
