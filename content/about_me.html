			<h3>Where did it all began</h3>
			<p>
				Born and raised in Patagonia, Argentina, 
				I grew up deeply connected to nature, 
				which I believe instilled in me a lifelong passion for understanding the world around me. 
				From a young age, 
				I was driven by curiosity, 
				a quality that led me to pursue a career in Physics. 
				Throughout my journey, 
				not only did I satisfy my thirst for knowledge, 
				but I also discovered an endless playground for exploration. 
				There's something exhilarating about tackling a new challenge, 
				carefully planning a project, 
				and diving into the complexities where models, methods, and tools are tested. 
				However, what truly excites me is that, at the end of the process, 
				the team grows in understanding, 
				and we’re able to deliver real, 
				tangible value to clients or colleagues.

				<!-- Born and raised in Patagonia Argentina,
				I grew up very close to nature which I believe seed a passion for the world around me.
				I recall being very curious since an early age,
				and thankfully I carried that to eventually pursue a career in Physics.
				Along my journey I not only fulfilled that hunger for knowledge but also I found myself in a never ending playground.
				It is exciting to tackle a new problem,
				to plan the project and it is a thrill to dive into the struggle;
				where we put ourselves, our models, our methods and our tools to a test.
				But perhaps what is more important is that at the end of the task,
				the team has grown in understanding and we can provide real,
				tangible value to our clients or colleagues. -->
			</p>
			<span class="image right"><img src="images/my_picture.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				I am fortunate to have had the guidance of outstanding mentors—many of them professors—who shared their time and knowledge with me, 
				and who instilled in me values that have shaped my professional life. 
				These include dedication, commitment, respect for schedules, collaboration, and perseverance. 
				Perhaps the most valuable lesson I took from my academic years, though, was the importance of teamwork. 
				Science, like any meaningful endeavor, is a collective pursuit, and the best work is often the result of collaborative effort. 
				These principles have remained central to my career and continue to guide me as I take on new challenges.

				<!-- I was quite wise to follow great mentors that came along,
				many professors that not only shared their time and knowledge but that taught me great values for my professional life,
				I am talking <i>dedication</i>, <i>commitment</i>, <i>honor to the schedules</i>, <i>fellowship</i> and <i>perseverance</i>.
				But perhaps the most fundamental and useful tool that I got to practice through all my university years was the art of team-working.
				There is no science without that ingredient nor fun at all.
				So those elements are not only always strongly present in my mind,
				but I believe they drove me,
				along with my friends and colleagues to face our first projects. -->
			</p>
			<h3>The road of an Applied Scientist</h3>
			<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FIRST PROJECTs-->
			<p>
				Over the course of my Master's, 
				I worked on two projects that highlight some of my key strengths and personal attributes. 
				The first was my first real experience in a research team, 
				where I had the opportunity to study the behavior of autonomous systems—specifically, the flight patterns of bird flocks. 
				While this may seem abstract, 
				it’s a classic example of how different systems can exhibit similar behaviors despite their apparent differences. 
				Thanks to concepts from Statistical Mechanics, 
				we discovered that such systems share common properties, 
				which can help us extrapolate results from controlled environments to more complex, 
				real-world scenarios. 
				In our case, 
				we used a Vicsek Simulation to explore how different dynamic models affect the flight patterns of bird flocks. 
				The technical results were fascinating, 
				but the real value for me came from applying my knowledge of Statistical Mechanics and analysis to a tangible problem, 
				while also improving my programming skills in simulation.

				<!-- I think there are two very different projects,
				that without going to much into detail,
				showcase some of my key personal attributes.
				Both of them were carried out my last two years of Master,
				but the first one was my first experience working in a real research team in an active field of study,
				on a topic relevant for many scenarios;
				I am talking about studying the behavior of a collection of autonomous objects.

				There are many systems that fit in that previous description,
				to mention only a few,
				we have: the flight patterns of a flock of birds,
				the growth patterns of a population of bacteria,
				and many others.
				Physicists have found, through Statistical Mechanics,
				that many systems share common behaviors and properties even though they might be very different at first glance,
				this is known as been part of a class of universality;
				and its extension and applicability is huge,
				since it allows to extrapolate results from controlled environment to very complex systems.
				Now in this context is where we carried a Vicksek Simulation,
				to study the effects of different model dynamics on the flight patterns of birds of flocks.
				There results are quite technical,
				but the whole process was a great experience where I improved my programming skills for simulations,
				and it was the first real problem where I applied my knowledge on Statistical Mechanics and Statistical Analysis. -->
			</p>
			<p>
				The second project was a BusLine-Layout Optimization for my city’s public transportation system. 
				I tend to be proactive in identifying new challenges, and at that time, 
				I wanted to apply my skills in programming and analysis to a real-world issue. 
				I began working on a model to optimize the layout of the bus lines, and soon, some friends and colleagues joined me. 
				Our work progressed to the point where we were able to present our ideas to the transit council. 
				Although they appreciated the project, 
				they ultimately lacked the resources to implement it—something I now understand is a common hurdle in such initiatives.

				<!-- The second project was a BusLine-Layout Optimization for my city's bus system.
				I am very proactive to tackle new projects,
				and at the time I was looking for a project to extend and practice my programming and analysis skills,
				so I started working on a model to improve the BusLine system of my city.
				Happily, some of my friends and colleagues join me in that task.
				We advanced enough to get a meeting with the transit council secretary,
				and even though they liked the project,
				they didn't have resources (and probably neither will) to deploy the project. -->
			</p>
			<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FREELANCE PROJECTS-->
			<p>
				My passion for using scientific methods to improve the world around me has only grown. 
				Outside of my academic work, 
				I’ve taken on freelance Data Science projects, seeking out opportunities that allow me to challenge myself while delivering meaningful results. 
				These projects not only expanded my skill set but also taught me important lessons in customer service, project planning, and negotiation. 
				The positive feedback and perfect rating I received on Freelancer attest to the success of these efforts.

				<!-- This passion for improving my surrounding through hard,
				scientific work hasn't diminished,
				on the contrary,
				in my free time (if and when I get some) I worked as a freelance Data Scientist.
				I looked for projects I felt I could provide great value while being challenging within my skills set and in a reasonable time frame.
				Through these projects I was able to learn a lot about customer service, project planning & negotiation.
				I am very proud of what I accomplished,
				and the perfect rating in Freelancer backs it up. -->
			</p>

			<h3>From academic to applied research</h3>
			<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY MASTER THESIS AND PHD WORK-->
			<p>
				In my final year of the Master’s program, 
				I had the incredible opportunity to work with the High Energy Physics team at ATLAS - CERN from La Plata. 
				There, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to enhance the photon identification process using image data; 
				details <a href="projects/cnn_ph_id.html">here</a>.
				The project was a resounding success—not only technically, 
				but also in terms of the collaboration itself. 
				It marked the beginning of a series of ongoing projects that would extend into my PhD work.
				<br>

				Working within the ATLAS collaboration was also an invaluable learning experience. 
				It’s one of the world’s most prestigious scientific communities, 
				and the collaborative dynamics are similar to those found in large organizations across any industry. 
				The scale of the ATLAS project and its global scope brought me face-to-face with the complexities of team coordination, 
				resource management, and maintaining scientific rigor in a large, diverse environment. 
				These lessons are incredibly transferable and continue to influence my professional approach today.

				<!-- To wrap up this section I want to share some of my experience in the academic so far.
				I began working with the High Energy Physics team at ATLAS - CERN from La Plata in my final Master year of college,
				when we chose to develop a DNN model to improve the photon identification process using images.
				This project was a success beyond the technical aspect and opened the door to its extension during my PhD.
				But it was also a rich learning experience where I got to learn from the best community of scientist in the world.
				The work dynamic at the ATLAS collaboration is very similar to any company around the world due to the size and extension of its structure,
				and thus faces the same issues. -->
			</p>
			<!-- DESCRIPTION OF MY ROLE IN WLS -->
			<p>
				I joined Wildlife Studios as a core member of a newly-formed team dedicated to supporting the Digital Marketing division. 
				The main objective of the role was to maximize the ROI of marketing campaigns. 
				To achieve this, I led several key initiatives, including:
				<ul>
				<li>
				Conducting A/B testing and control experiments to validate and predict campaign performance,
				in <a href="projects/xPromo.html">this project</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
				Developing <a href="projects/inspector_tool.html">tools</a> to track and monitor critical KPIs that measured the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
				</li>
				<li>
				Building and deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models to identify high-revenue opportunities.
				More on that <a href="projects/cpa_evt_opt.html">here</a>.
				</li>
				</ul>
				In this capacity, 
				I took on a leadership role, 
				guiding the team both technically and strategically. 
				This required regular collaboration with VP-level stakeholders and cross-functional leaders to ensure alignment on goals and execution.

				While my time at Wildlife Studios was highly rewarding, 
				it eventually paved the way for an even more exciting opportunity at TRACTIAN.

				<!-- I joint Wildlife Studios to become a member of a new small team that provided support for the Digital Marketing squads. -->
				<!-- The general premise of the role was to maximize the ROI of marketing campaigns. -->
				<!-- Achieving such goal would imply carrying out control experiments (A/B tests) to validate or project the performance of campaigns or their adjustments; -->
				<!-- developing tools to monitor the evolution of critical KPIs that described the performance of such campaings; -->
				<!-- and developing state-of-the-art ML models to find high revenue opportunities. -->
				<!---->
				<!-- In this role I was actively leading the team both from a technical and product point of view, -->
				<!-- which implied having close relationship with VP-level stakeholders and cross team leaders. -->
				<!---->
				<!-- The role was very rewarding, -->
				<!-- but not as much as the opportunity that would come later with TRACTIAN. -->
			</p>

			<!-- DESCRIPTION OF MY ROLE IN TRACTIAN -->
			<p>
				When TRACTIAN reached out to me, 
				the company was still in its early startup phase. 
				Initially, 
				my role was to develop machine learning models to detect anomalous behavior in time-series data—critical to the company's core product. 
				TRACTIAN provides preventive alerts for industrial machines, 
				and the models I built were responsible for early, 
				accurate identification of potential failures, 
				helping clients avoid costly downtime.
				<br>

				This project was especially exciting because it bridged applied physics and statistics. 
				However, as I gained a deeper understanding of the product, 
				I identified a number of blockers that were hindering the growth of the data department. 
				These included a lack of team structure, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficient resources.
				<br>

				The data teams lacked clear roles and structure. 
				Specifically, there were no distinct divisions between Data Engineering, Machine Learning Operations, Data Research, and Data Products teams. 
				This led to everyone contributing to multiple projects, making it difficult to maintain a clear, unified vision. 
				To address this, 
				I introduced a more structured team framework and took on the role of Data Products Team Lead, 
				focusing on performance optimization.
				<br>

				On the infrastructure side, 
				we lacked a proper Data Lake to manage our multiple databases, 
				a system to evaluate product performance in depth, 
				and cleaned, labeled datasets for the Data Research team. 
				I delegated the Data Lake issue to the Data Engineering team, 
				as it fell within their scope. 
				Meanwhile, as Performance Lead, I took responsibility for building frameworks and tools to assess model performance at various stages:
				<ul>
				<li>
				Evaluating individual model performance within the overall model suite.
				</li>
				<li>
				Assessing performance at scale, both at the company level and in customer environments.
				</li>
				<li>
				Analyzing customer feedback to refine our models and overall product quality.
				</li>
				</ul>
				Simultaneously, 
				leveraging my background as an experimental physicist, 
				I guided the Data Research team in addressing the dataset issue. 
				This challenge required a multi-pronged approach:
				<ul>
				<li>
				We established a Lab to facilitate research and controlled dataset creation.
				</li>
				<li>
				We used organic cases from our platform to build real-world datasets.
				</li>
				<li>
				I developed a <a href="projects/sample_simulator_tool.html">synthetic sample simulation engine</a> to augment and bridge gaps between the two types of datasets.
				
				</li>
				</ul>
				These efforts were crucial in overcoming the barriers that initially hindered our progress and set the foundation for scaling the data department.

        <!-- TRACTIAN reached out to me when the company was still in an early start-up stage. -->
        <!-- My original role was to develop ML models to identify annomalous behavior in time-series data. -->
        <!-- This task was critical to the main product of the company as TRACTIAN sells preventive alerts to industrial malfunctioning machines, -->
        <!-- so the models I developed where responsible for early and accurate identification of possible failures. -->
        <!---->
        <!-- The project was very exciting as it overlaped applyed physics with statistics. -->
        <!-- However, as I became more knowledgable of the product I identified a number of blockers that were preventing the data department growth. -->
        <!-- We had a cocktail of crucial issues to address that combined poor team structure, lack of critical infrastructure and resources. -->
        <!---->
        <!-- On the team structure side, -->
        <!-- we didn't have a proper delimitation between the Data Engineering, Machine Learning Operations, Data Research and Data Products teams; -->
        <!-- quite frankly they didn't exists. -->
        <!-- So everyone was contributing to many projects, -->
        <!-- which made a challenge to follow a clear vision. -->
        <!-- It's in that context that I introduced the Team structure described above and took the role of *Data Products Team Lead* with focus on *performance*. -->
        <!---->
        <!-- At the same time, -->
        <!-- we were lacking an apropiate *Data Lake* to host our multiple databases, -->
        <!-- we were lacking a framework to deeply evaluate our product performance, -->
        <!-- and we were lacking cleaned and labeled datasets to feed the Data Reserach Team. -->
        <!-- I let the Data Engineering team handle the *Data Lake* issue as it naturally falls into their scope and responsabilities. -->
        <!-- As the *Performance Lead*, I focused on tackling the performance evaluation issue, -->
        <!-- which included crafting many custom tools, frameworks and libraries to compute the performance at different stages, -->
        <!-- we had to look for the isolated performance of any model in our model-suit, -->
        <!-- the performance of their output at company scale, -->
        <!-- and the customer experience and feedback quality, -->
        <!-- to finally tight it all together. -->
        <!-- Simultaneously, -->
        <!-- given my experience as an experimental physicist, -->
        <!-- I guided the Data Research Team into handling the datasets issue. -->
        <!-- Such blocker required three fronts of attack, -->
        <!-- we installed a Lab to obviously enable research, -->
        <!-- but also to build controlled datasets. -->
        <!-- We built datasets from an organic cases we found in our platform. -->
        <!-- And I built a synthetic sample simulation engine to augment and breach the gap between the two previous types of datasets. -->
