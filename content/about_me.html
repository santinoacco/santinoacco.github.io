			<h3>Where did it all began</h3>
			<p>
				Born and raised in Patagonia, Argentina, 
				I grew up deeply connected to nature, 
				which I believe instilled in me a lifelong passion for understanding the world around me. 
				From a young age, 
				I was driven by curiosity, 
				a quality that led me to pursue a career in Physics. 
				Throughout my journey, 
				not only did I satisfy my thirst for knowledge, 
				but I also discovered an endless playground for exploration. 
				There's something exhilarating about tackling a new challenge, 
				carefully planning a project, 
				and diving into the complexities where models, methods, and tools are tested. 
				However, what truly excites me is that, at the end of the process, 
				the team grows in understanding, 
				and we’re able to deliver real, 
				tangible value to clients or colleagues.

				<!-- Born and raised in Patagonia Argentina,
				I grew up very close to nature which I believe seed a passion for the world around me.
				I recall being very curious since an early age,
				and thankfully I carried that to eventually pursue a career in Physics.
				Along my journey I not only fulfilled that hunger for knowledge but also I found myself in a never ending playground.
				It is exciting to tackle a new problem,
				to plan the project and it is a thrill to dive into the struggle;
				where we put ourselves, our models, our methods and our tools to a test.
				But perhaps what is more important is that at the end of the task,
				the team has grown in understanding and we can provide real,
				tangible value to our clients or colleagues. -->
			</p>
			<span class="image right"><img src="images/my_picture.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				I am fortunate to have had the guidance of outstanding mentors—many of them professors—who shared their time and knowledge with me, 
				and who instilled in me values that have shaped my professional life. 
				These include dedication, commitment, respect for schedules, collaboration, and perseverance. 
				Perhaps the most valuable lesson I took from my academic years, though, was the importance of teamwork. 
				Science, like any meaningful endeavor, is a collective pursuit, and the best work is often the result of collaborative effort. 
				These principles have remained central to my career and continue to guide me as I take on new challenges.

				<!-- I was quite wise to follow great mentors that came along,
				many professors that not only shared their time and knowledge but that taught me great values for my professional life,
				I am talking <i>dedication</i>, <i>commitment</i>, <i>honor to the schedules</i>, <i>fellowship</i> and <i>perseverance</i>.
				But perhaps the most fundamental and useful tool that I got to practice through all my university years was the art of team-working.
				There is no science without that ingredient nor fun at all.
				So those elements are not only always strongly present in my mind,
				but I believe they drove me,
				along with my friends and colleagues to face our first projects. -->

			<h3>The road of an Applied Scientist</h3>
			<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FIRST PROJECTs-->
			<p>
				Over the course of my Master's, 
				I worked on two projects that highlight some of my key strengths and personal attributes. 
				The first was my first real experience in a research team, 
				where I had the opportunity to study the behavior of autonomous systems—specifically, the flight patterns of bird flocks. 
				While this may seem abstract, 
				it’s a classic example of how different systems can exhibit similar behaviors despite their apparent differences. 
				Thanks to concepts from Statistical Mechanics, 
				we discovered that such systems share common properties, 
				which can help us extrapolate results from controlled environments to more complex, 
				real-world scenarios. 
				In our case, 
				we used a Vicsek Simulation to explore how different dynamic models affect the flight patterns of bird flocks. 
				The technical results were fascinating, 
				but the real value for me came from applying my knowledge of Statistical Mechanics and analysis to a tangible problem, 
				while also improving my programming skills in simulation.

				<!-- I think there are two very different projects,
				that without going to much into detail,
				showcase some of my key personal attributes.
				Both of them were carried out my last two years of Master,
				but the first one was my first experience working in a real research team in an active field of study,
				on a topic relevant for many scenarios;
				I am talking about studying the behavior of a collection of autonomous objects.

				There are many systems that fit in that previous description,
				to mention only a few,
				we have: the flight patterns of a flock of birds,
				the growth patterns of a population of bacteria,
				and many others.
				Physicists have found, through Statistical Mechanics,
				that many systems share common behaviors and properties even though they might be very different at first glance,
				this is known as been part of a class of universality;
				and its extension and applicability is huge,
				since it allows to extrapolate results from controlled environment to very complex systems.
				Now in this context is where we carried a Vicksek Simulation,
				to study the effects of different model dynamics on the flight patterns of birds of flocks.
				There results are quite technical,
				but the whole process was a great experience where I improved my programming skills for simulations,
				and it was the first real problem where I applied my knowledge on Statistical Mechanics and Statistical Analysis. -->
			</p>
			<p>
				The second project was a BusLine-Layout Optimization for my city’s public transportation system. 
				I tend to be proactive in identifying new challenges, and at that time, 
				I wanted to apply my skills in programming and analysis to a real-world issue. 
				I began working on a model to optimize the layout of the bus lines, and soon, some friends and colleagues joined me. 
				Our work progressed to the point where we were able to present our ideas to the transit council. 
				Although they appreciated the project, 
				they ultimately lacked the resources to implement it—something I now understand is a common hurdle in such initiatives.

				<!-- The second project was a BusLine-Layout Optimization for my city's bus system.
				I am very proactive to tackle new projects,
				and at the time I was looking for a project to extend and practice my programming and analysis skills,
				so I started working on a model to improve the BusLine system of my city.
				Happily, some of my friends and colleagues join me in that task.
				We advanced enough to get a meeting with the transit council secretary,
				and even though they liked the project,
				they didn't have resources (and probably neither will) to deploy the project. -->
			</p>
			<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FREELANCE PROJECTS-->
			<p>
				My passion for using scientific methods to improve the world around me has only grown. 
				Outside of my academic work, 
				I’ve taken on freelance Data Science projects, seeking out opportunities that allow me to challenge myself while delivering meaningful results. 
				These projects not only expanded my skill set but also taught me important lessons in customer service, project planning, and negotiation. 
				The positive feedback and perfect rating I received on Freelancer attest to the success of these efforts.

				<!-- This passion for improving my surrounding through hard,
				scientific work hasn't diminished,
				on the contrary,
				in my free time (if and when I get some) I worked as a freelance Data Scientist.
				I looked for projects I felt I could provide great value while being challenging within my skills set and in a reasonable time frame.
				Through these projects I was able to learn a lot about customer service, project planning & negotiation.
				I am very proud of what I accomplished,
				and the perfect rating in Freelancer backs it up. -->
			</p>
			<h3>Academic and research experiences</h3>
			<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY MASTER THESIS AND CURRENT PHD WORK-->
			<p>
				In my final year of the Master’s program, 
				I had the incredible opportunity to work with the High Energy Physics team at ATLAS - CERN from La Plata. 
				There, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to enhance the photon identification process using image data. 
				The project was a resounding success—not only technically, but also in terms of the collaboration itself. 
				It marked the beginning of a series of ongoing projects that would extend into my PhD work.

				Working within the ATLAS collaboration was also an invaluable learning experience. 
				It’s one of the world’s most prestigious scientific communities, 
				and the collaborative dynamics are similar to those found in large organizations across any industry. 
				The scale of the ATLAS project and its global scope brought me face-to-face with the complexities of team coordination, 
				resource management, and maintaining scientific rigor in a large, diverse environment. 
				These lessons are incredibly transferable and continue to influence my professional approach today.

				<!-- To wrap up this section I want to share some of my experience in the academic so far.
				I began working with the High Energy Physics team at ATLAS - CERN from La Plata in my final Master year of college,
				when we chose to develop a DNN model to improve the photon identification process using images.
				This project was a success beyond the technical aspect and opened the door to its extension during my PhD.
				But it was also a rich learning experience where I got to learn from the best community of scientist in the world.
				The work dynamic at the ATLAS collaboration is very similar to any company around the world due to the size and extension of its structure,
				and thus faces the same issues. -->
			</p>
			<!-- DESCRIPTION OF MY ROLE IN WLS -->
			<p>
				I joint Wildlife Studios to become a member of a new small team that provided support for the Digital Marketing squads.
				The general premise of the role was to maximize the ROI of marketing campaigns.
				Achieving such goal would imply carrying out control experiments (A/B tests) to validate or project the performance of campaigns or their adjustments;
				developing tools to monitor the evolution of critical KPIs that described the performance of such campaings;
				and developing state-of-the-art ML models to find high revenue opportunities.

				In this role I was actively leading the team both from a technical and product point of view,
				which implied having close relationship with VP-level stakeholders and cross team leaders.
				
				The role was very rewarding,
				but not as much as the opportunity that would come after with TRACTIAN.
