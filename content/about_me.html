						<h3>Where did it all began</h3>
						<p>
							Born and raised in Patagonia Argentina,
							I grew up very close to nature which I believe seed a passion for the world around me.
							I recall being very curious since an early age,
							and thankfully I carried that to eventually pursue a career in Physics.
							Along my journey I not only fulfilled that hunger for knowledge but also I found myself in a never ending playground.
							It is exciting to tackle a new problem,
							to plan the project and it is a thrill to dive into the struggle;
							where we put ourselves, our models, our methods and our tools to a test.
							But perhaps what is more important is that at the end of the task,
							the team has grown in understanding and we can provide real,
							tangible value to our clients or colleagues.
						</p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/my_picture.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							I was quite wise to follow great mentors that came along,
							many professors that not only shared their time and knowledge but that taught me great values for my professional life,
							I am talking <i>dedication</i>, <i>commitment</i>, <i>honor to the schedules</i>, <i>fellowship</i> and <i>perseverance</i>.
							But perhaps the most fundamental and useful tool that I got to practice through all my university years was the art of team-working.
							There is no science without that ingredient nor fun at all.
							So those elements are not only always strongly present in my mind,
							but I believe they drove me,
							along with my friends and colleagues to face our first projects.
						</p>
						<h3>The road of an Applied Scientist</h3>
						<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FIRST PROJECTs-->
						<p>
							I think there are two very different projects,
							that without going to much into detail,
							showcase some of my key personal attributes.
							Both of them were carried out my last two years of Master,
							but the first one was my first experience working in a real research team in an active field of study,
							on a topic relevant for many scenarios;
							I am talking about studying the behavior of a collection of autonomous objects.
							There are many systems that fit in that previous description,
							to mention only a few,
							we have: the flight patterns of a flock of birds,
							the growth patterns of a population of bacteria,
							and many others.
							Physicists have found, through Statistical Mechanics,
							that many systems share common behaviors and properties even though they might be very different at first glance,
							this is known as been part of a class of universality;
							and its extension and applicability is huge,
							since it allows to extrapolate results from controlled environment to very complex systems.
							Now in this context is where we carried a Vicksek Simulation,
							to study the effects of different model dynamics on the flight patterns of birds of flocks.
							There results are quite technical,
							but the whole process was a great experience where I improved my programming skills for simulations,
							and it was the first real problem where I applied my knowledge on Statistical Mechanics and Statistical Analysis.
							The second project was a BusLine-Layout Optimization for my city's bus system.
							I am very proactive to tackle new projects,
							and at the time I was looking for a project to extend and practice my programming and analysis skills,
							so I started working on a model to improve the BusLine system of my city.
							Happily, some of my friends and colleagues join me in that task.
							We advanced enough to get a meeting with the transit council secretary,
							and even though they liked the project,
							they didn't have resources (and probably neither will) to deploy the project.
						</p>
						<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY FREELANCE PROJECTS-->
						<p>
							This passion for improving my surrounding through hard,
							scientific work hasn't diminished,
							on the contrary,
							in my free time (if and when I get some) I worked as a freelance Data Scientist.
							I looked for projects I felt I could provide great value while being challenging within my skills set and in a reasonable time frame.
							Through these projects I was able to learn a lot about customer service, project planning & negotiation.
							I am very proud of what I accomplished,
							and the perfect rating in Freelancer backs it up.
						</p>
						<!--DESCRIPTION OF MY MASTER THESIS AND CURRENT PHD WORK-->
						<p>
							To wrap up this section I want to share some of my experience in the academic so far.
							I began working with the High Energy Physics team at ATLAS - CERN from La Plata in my final Master year of college,
							when we chose to develop a DNN model to improve the photon identification process using images.
							This project was a success beyond the technical aspect and opened the door to its extension during my PhD.
							But it was also a rich learning experience where I got to learn from the best community of scientist in the world.
							The work dynamic at the ATLAS collaboration is very similar to any company around the world due to the size and extension of its structure,
							and thus faces the same issues.
						</p>
						<h3>Industry experience</h3>
						<!-- DESCRIPTION OF MY ROLE IN WLS -->
						<p>
							I joint Wildlife Studios to become a member of a new built small team that provided support for the Digital Marketing squads.
							Our responsibilities were to provide tools & solutions to improve the effectiveness, revenue & reach of marketing campaigns,
							and to provide expert opinion to help directors in making the best possible investments and overall decisions.
							... for example the <a href="projects/cpa_evt_opt.html"> CPA project</a> 
							... for example the <a href="projects/inspector_tool.html"> Inspector tool</a> 
							... for example the <a href="projects/xPromo.html"> Cross Promo campaign study</a>
