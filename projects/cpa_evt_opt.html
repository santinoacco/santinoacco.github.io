									The goal of the project was to increase the revenue and user volume for the games through a novel type of digital publishing campaigns.
									In a digital publishing campaign the advertising company pays the publisher for users, 
									where the publisher is usually an AdNet like Google, Facebook, etc.
									The execution of this task from the AdNet side is framed in a "campaign",
									which specifies the target and the price of the users.
									Common targets aim to deliver users that will "convert" or will download the app (game),
									this project implemented campaigns that targeted users that will trigger a game-action.
									The motivation to use this type of campaigns called CPA (cost per action) instead of the conventional ones is two fold,
									firstly the net cost is cheaper due to lower ROI estimation from the AdNet.
									Secondly we have access to fully controlled data that gives us access to key exploitation points,
									which we can drive to higher conversion from users in unexplored market shares.
								</p>
								<p>
									To achieve this goal we delivered a framework to search, qualify, launch & monitor these campaigns.
									The framework implemented four stages and involved instances of techniques such as
									Clustering methods, Decision Trees, Bayesian Statistics, Visualization and more.
									The first stage provided tools to find the in-game-actions (or events) that would provide the best campaign outcome.
									The second stage estimated the performance of each possible campaign based on these events.
									The third stage selected the deployable campaigns and launch them.
									The fourth stage monitor & optimized the production performance.
								</p>
								<p>
									<!-- %1st Stage details -->
									The definition of success for the first stage meant to overcome an overwhelming noisy search of possible events for each game,
									since...
									(we want events that are highly correlated to conversion)
									Although the data is structured in tables which we have great control on,
									the space of possibilities is so large that a brute-force approach was impossible (impractical) for the time cost it would imply.
									Two tools where provided and deployed to the relevant teams to achieve the task,
									a Forensic Tool and an Event Search Pipeline.
									The first one packaged a collection of queries and interactive visualizations to address a game play story-line for targeted users.
